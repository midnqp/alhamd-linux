 Headstart of context & knowledge to whoever wants to understand/build an OS.





----THE OPENING----
This repository provides required scripts to build a very minimal OS.
  [+] build-rootfs.sh    - Create a `chroot`-able rootfs.
  [-] package-manager.py - Debian-based precompiled binaries
                         - With dependencies.
  [+] resources/         - Help you take off! Where do you proceed next.
                         - Things to try/learn next. Awesome-list.
  [+] toolchain          - musl-libc, gcc, make, ...




> An operating system may be called "independent", if it is mature enough to host a development environment for itself. That requires 3 components:
          (1) A Kernel
          (2) A commandline
          (3) A toolchain (libc, gcc, make, ...)
> alhamd-linux tries a different approach to get far away from systemd-like higher-level abstraction softwares to achieve the simplest & most minimal build of an operating system.




----INEVITABLE MARCH TOWARDS THE GRAND ENDING----
alhamd-linux will be considered mature if:
  [1] hamd (alhamd-linux package manager) can resolve dependency conflicts. Using Debian prebuilt binaries is completely okay. We cannot use `apt` because it brings `systemd`.
  [2] Xorg + dwm
  [3] Chromium
  [4] Be able to do `hamd install ~/Downloads/opera-stable-latest.deb`
